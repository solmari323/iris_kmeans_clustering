# Incremental KMeans Clustering Algorithm vs Standard Kmeans Clustering Algorithm on the Iris Dataset

My implementation of the Incremental Kmeans ALgorithm as a part of University of Exeter Computer Science Coursework.
**Module:** Learning from Data
**Topic:** Clustering

The incremental kmeans algorithm is an attempt to optimize the computational cost of the kmeans clustering algorithm, while still retaining moderately similar results accuracy.

## How to Run
Download the python notebook/clone the repository and run the notebook.
